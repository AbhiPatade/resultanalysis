# resultanalysis
This project shows result analysis from PDF file. PDF file is just readable file when the university declare the result then   it is hard to analysis this file and categorized this result in the subject wise result of the student. This system is developed   for analysis of the university  PDF file which includes the student result. In this project subjectwise result analysis will be   calculated and we are able to show the whole file in text format also. Adobe acrobat reader software does not offer a text extraction tool. It discusses third-party software that can translate a pdf to text format. This system shows all clear   and backlog student number. Also the subjectwise anlysis also generated. Pass and fail student count in particular subject   is also calulated by using thi software. With the help of this software we are able to print the whole document which is   converted  in text format. This system shows the individual student result also. This system helps to teachers to analyse the result of college or particular department.
